# N Body Gravitational Simulator

I quickly coded this customizable simulator in JS to emulate gravitational interactions between masses. Keep in mind that as simulation speed increases, the time delta will result in less accurate simulation.

Also I acknowledge my limitations in the area of physics, so I cannot guarantee the simulation will be 100% accurate.
